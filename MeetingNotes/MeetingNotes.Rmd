# Guevara-Heun meeting notes


## 16 February 2024

### Review previous action items

- [x] ZG: Look up Lenzen reference on LMDI and matrices (Brazil)
- [ ] ZG: Review vignette for `LMDIR` package at https://matthewheun.github.io/LMDIR/articles/LMDIR.html. 
- [ ] ZG: Add files to GitHub
- [x] MKH: Provide a graph of shares of technologies for each country. Do both sums of V rows and sums of U columns. Make a data frame and send to Zeus for analysis.  Send absolute values to Zeus, not fractions. Data frame will have Country, Year, Industry, matrix, V_row_sum or U_col_sum.

### Previous action items:

- [x] ZG: Suggest more aggregations using the new format defined for the pipeline
- [x] ZG: Look through each technology to suggest which ones to aggregate


## 19 January 2024

### Previous action items:

- [x] ZG: Suggest more aggregations using the new format defined for the pipeline
- [x] ZG: Look through each technology to suggest which ones to aggregate

Discussion notes:

* Need to define a criteria for identifying problematic 
  machine efficiencies.
* Then set an alarm to look at those 
  problematic machine efficiencies.
* Need to decide what to do with the impossible trends.
  - Aggregate?
  - Fix?
* Identify countries with most problems, because
  they will become the norm for the rest of the database.
* Possible criteria for problematic efficiencies:
  - Oil refineries: Set max growth or decline from one year to another.
  - Need to check contribution to energy story (percentage) before
    deciding to "fix" or adjust.


## 8 December 2023

### Previous action items:

- [x] MKH: Aggregate Transfers to Oil refineries in ITA for 2000-2008
- [x] MKH: Aggregate Solar, Wind, Hydro, and Geothermal to Renewable electricity for 2015 for all countries
- [x] MKH: Aggregate Coke ovens, Blast furnaces, and Gas works to "Iron industry" for ITA for all years
- [ ] ZG: Suggest more aggregations using the new format defined for the pipeline

Discussion notes:

* Next steps: 
    - Decide objectives of the study, which will help us to decide aggregations.
    - Specify aggregations
    

### New action items:

None.


## 13 October 2023

### Previous action items:

- [x] MKH: Combine "For blended natural gas" and "Natural gas extraction" in every country.
- [x] MKH: Build a system to to enable aggregations in arbitrary countries and years.
- [x] MKH: Write ECC matrices for ITA in 2000 and 2018 to an Excel file
           for inspection at next meeting.
- [x] MKH: Build a file in our GitHub repository to assist with action items. (This file!)

Discussion notes:

* We need to figure out how to deal with Losses
    - Add to U_EIOU (and U)
    - Subtract from V
* We need to figure out how to deal with Transfers.
  Want a algorithm that tells how to deal with lossses
  in a general way.
